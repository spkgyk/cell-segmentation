# Cell Segmentation & Classification

## Task 1: Image Patch Extraction and Cell Segmentation
Developed a data analysis pipeline to extract image patches from whole slide images (WSIs) and perform cell segmentation on each patch. Discussed limitations of the chosen cell segmentation model and suggested improvements.

## Task 2: Statistical Analyses of Cell Detection Results  
Analyzed data from a randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the effects of a drug on changes in a specific cell type. Proposed statistical hypotheses, identified cell-based features, and determined appropriate testing methods.

## Task 3: Software Design
Designed an end-to-end Python pipeline that takes WSIs as input, performs machine learning inference and statistical analysis, and outputs a reproducible statistical report. Created a diagram outlining the modules involved and provided pseudo code for each function/method.
